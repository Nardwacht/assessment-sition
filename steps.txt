1. Understand the Requirements
Review the Figma design thoroughly:
Look at the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and interactive elements.
Identify reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals).
Understand the JSON file:
Check the structure and purpose of the data (e.g., a list of items for display, configuration details).
Assess the provided images:
Match them with their use in the Figma design (e.g., banners, icons).

2. Set Up the Development Environment
Tools:
Install a text editor (e.g., VS Code).
Install necessary packages or libraries (e.g., React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS, depending on the requirement).
Folder Structure:
/project
├── /assets        # Store images
├── /data          # Store JSON file
├── /components    # Reusable components (if using a framework)
├── index.html     # Main HTML file
├── style.css      # CSS file
├── script.js      # JS file
Version Control:
Initialize a Git repository to track your progress.

3. Break Down the Design
Divide the Figma design into sections (header, main content, footer).
Identify responsive behavior (e.g., changes for mobile and tablet views).
Note interactive elements (hover effects, modals, etc.).

4. Set Up the Base Project
HTML:
Create a semantic structure based on the design.
Use placeholders for dynamic data (e.g., <div id="content"></div>).
CSS:
Define global styles (fonts, colors, spacing).
Use a CSS preprocessor like SASS if needed.
JavaScript:
Load the JSON file (if dynamic data is required).
Start with static data for initial UI rendering.

5. Start Building Section by Section
Header:
Implement the navigation bar and logo.
Add functionality for menu toggling if the design is responsive.
Main Content:
Build reusable components (e.g., cards for displaying JSON data).
Dynamically load and display data from the JSON file.
Footer:
Add links, copyright, or other information as per the design.
6. Incorporate Styles
Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
Apply spacing, typography, and colors from the design.
Test responsiveness using browser dev tools.
7. Add Interactivity
Use JavaScript (or framework features) for dynamic content.
Implement hover effects, modals, or other animations as specified.
Ensure data from the JSON file is correctly displayed and updated if applicable.
8. Optimize and Test
Browser Compatibility:
Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Responsiveness:
Verify appearance on different screen sizes.
Performance:
Optimize images and minimize CSS/JS files if necessary.
Accessibility:
Use semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and ARIA roles.
9. Document Your Work
Write a README file explaining:
How to run the project.
Any dependencies or frameworks used.
How the JSON file is used.
Include comments in your code for clarity.
10. Submit the Assignment
Ensure all files are included and organized.
Double-check the submission guidelines (e.g., zip file, GitHub repo link).
Preview the project to confirm it matches the Figma design.
Tips:
Use placeholders to test layouts before integrating real data.
Take screenshots of your progress to stay aligned with the design.
Manage time effectively—prioritize core functionality before enhancements.
